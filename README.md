ML Project Repository â€“ Bank Churn Prediction & Movie Genre Classification

This repository contains **two machine learning projects**, each in its own folder with complete code files and individual README files for better understanding and navigation.

##  Projects Included

### 1. **Bank Customer Churn Prediction**
- **Goal**: Predict whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) using various classification algorithms.
- **Tech Stack**: XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, ANN
- **Highlights**:
  - SMOTE used for balancing the dataset
  - Accuracy and precision compared with and without SMOTE
-  Refer to the project-specific `README_Churn_prediction.md` inside the folder for more details.
-  Code file - churn_prediction.ipynb

### 2. **Movie Genre Classification**
- **Goal**: Predict multiple genres for a given movie description using an LSTM model.
- **Tech Stack**: GloVe Embeddings, LSTM (Keras), Multi-label Classification
- **Highlights**:
  - Custom IMDb-style dataset
  - Text preprocessing with tokenizer and embeddings
-  Refer to the project-specific `README_Genre_prediction.md` inside the folder for more details.
-  Code file - genre_classify.ipynb
